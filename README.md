## This repo contains the contents for the Project 2 assignment. Two datasets on movies were taken from two sources and the information was merged to be easier to use.

## Data from the omdb_data.csv was taken from OMDB's API, which can be found on this website: http://www.omdbapi.com 

## Data from the netflix_titles.csv was taken from kaggle.com, specifically this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows



To do list:

1. Give the data a primary key
2. Merge the two datasets
3. Clean the two datasets (throw out rows, make Na's more uniform)
