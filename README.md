## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to utilzie a dataset from kaggle.com which consists of 8000 plus Netflix Movies and TV shows, and combine those movies with a database generated from API requests from ombd.com. The combined table shows all of the Netflix Movies and TV shows along with the omdb data which includes things like IMDB rating, Metascore rating, and Boxoffice totals. There will be other useful columns within the combined table like movie rating (PG, PG-13, etc), that could be used for further analysis.
