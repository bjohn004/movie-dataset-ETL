## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to utilzie a dataset from kaggle.com which consists of 8000 plus Netflix Movies and TV shows, and combine those movies with a database generated from API requests from ombd.com. The combined table shows all of the Netflix Movies and TV shows along with the omdb data which includes things like IMDB rating, Metascore rating, and Boxoffice totals. There will be other useful columns within the combined table like movie rating (PG, PG-13, etc), that could be used for further analysis.

## This repo contains the contents for the Project 2 assignment. Two datasets on movies were taken from two sources and the information was merged to be easier to use.

## Data from the omdb_data.csv was taken from OMDB's API, which can be found on this website: http://www.omdbapi.com 

## Data from the netflix_titles.csv was taken from kaggle.com, specifically this page: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows



To do list:

1. Give the data a primary key
2. Merge the two datasets
3. Clean the two datasets (throw out rows, make Na's more uniform)
